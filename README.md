# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the systematic application of engineering princples,methods and tools to the development and maintaneance of high quality software systems.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? traditional programming is the use of manually created programm to run on a computer input to produce output.Software engineering on the other hand depends on created systems to give output from input in a computer.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.1.Requirements-refers to the gathering and documenting what the user needs from the software to be created. 2. Design-refers to the creating of a detailed designs and software architecture and user interface. 3. Implemantion- this is basically coding. Building the software according to the user needs and software designs and specifications. 4.Testing-this is making tests or runs to see if the software is functional and if it meeets the the quality standards intended.5.Deployment-This is realesing the software to the users or customers.6.Maintenance-This providing ongoing support after deployment.This is what we call updates.It is done to enhance quality and functionality of the software and is done by correcting previous mistakes or enancements.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?Agile is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and responing to change,while waterfall is the squential approach with disctinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall.Waterfall is best in short term projects and agile for long term projects.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

requirements are basically the characteristics a software is to have once created.The are both functianal and non functional.eg.Functional requirements for a banking software is the ability to create accounts.
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity in software design involves breaking down a system into smaller, independent components that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. It improves maintainability by allowing easier identification and isolation of issues within specific modules. Scalability is enhanced because new features or functionalities can be added by developing new modules without affecting existing ones, facilitating incremental growth.
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

1. Unit testing: Tests separate program modules or components separately. It guarantees that every item operates as intended.

2. Integration Testing: Examines how various modules or units interact with one another when integrated. It guarantees that units cooperate as planned.

3. System Testing: Examines the overall functioning of the system. System behavior is validated against both functional and non-functional requirements.

4. Acceptance Testing: Done to make sure the program satisfies user needs. It is typically the last stage prior to software deployment.

Because testing helps find bugs early, guarantees software quality, validates requirements, lowers risks, and boosts user pleasure, it is essential to software development.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that manage changes to source code and other files, tracking modifications, and facilitating collaboration among developers. They are crucial in software development for several reasons:

1.History Tracking: VCS keeps track of changes made to files over time, enabling developers to view previous versions, revert to earlier states, and understand the evolution of the codebase.

2.Collaboration: VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, managing conflicts and merging changes seamlessly.

3.Backup and Recovery: VCS provides a centralized repository for code, ensuring backups are maintained and facilitating recovery in case of data loss or system failures.

4.Branching and Merging: VCS enables developers to create branches to work on features or fixes independently, later merging them back into the main codebase, facilitating parallel development.

Examples of a version control systems and their features:

1.Git: Git is a distributed version control system known for its speed, scalability, and flexibility. It supports branching, merging, and distributed workflows, with platforms like GitHub and GitLab providing hosting and collaboration features

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The role of a software project manager involves:

1.Planning: Defining project scope, objectives, and timelines.

2.Resource Management: Allocating tasks, managing teams, and ensuring resources are used effectively.

3.Communication: Facilitating communication between stakeholders, teams, and clients.

4.Risk Management: Identifying and mitigating potential risks to project success.

5.Quality Assurance: Ensuring adherence to quality standards and overseeing testing processes.

Challenges include:

1.Scope Creep: Managing changes to project scope without impacting timelines or budgets.

2.Resource Constraints: Balancing project requirements with available resources.

3.Deadline Pressures: Meeting project deadlines while maintaining quality standards.

4.Stakeholder Expectations: Managing diverse stakeholder expectations and ensuring alignment with project goals.

5.Risk Mitigation: Proactively identifying and addressing potential risks to project success.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance involves modifying, updating, and enhancing existing software to ensure it continues to meet user needs, adapts to changing environments, and remains compatible with new technologies. 

Types of maintenance activities include:

1.Corrective Maintenance: Fixing defects or bugs in the software to restore its intended functionality.

2.Adaptive Maintenance: Making changes to the software to adapt it to new environments, such as operating systems or hardware platforms.

3.Perfective Maintenance: Enhancing the software to improve performance, usability, or maintainability, based on user feedback or changing requirements.

4.Preventive Maintenance: Proactively identifying and addressing potential issues to prevent future problems or improve system reliability.

Maintenance is essential in the software lifecycle because:

1.Sustaining Value: It ensures that software continues to deliver value to users over its lifetime by addressing issues and enhancing features.

2.Cost-Effectiveness: Maintaining existing software is often more cost-effective than building new systems from scratch.

3.Adaptability: Software needs to evolve to meet changing user needs, technological advancements, and business requirements.

4.Risk Reduction: Regular maintenance helps identify and mitigate risks associated with security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and compatibility problems.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
